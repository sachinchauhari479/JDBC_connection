# Employee Data CRUD Operations

This repository contains code and resources for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data using Java and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The purpose of this project is to provide a simple implementation of a backend system to manage employee records with fields including ID, name, city, and salary.

## Features

- Create new employee records by providing necessary details such as name, city, and salary.
- Read and retrieve employee information by employee ID or other search criteria.
- Update existing employee records with updated details.
- Delete employee records based on employee ID.
- Basic validation and error handling to ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: [Java](https://www.java.com/)
- Database Connectivity: [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/)
- Database: Any database supported by JDBC (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sachinchauhari479/JDBC_connection
   ```

2. Set up your database:
   - Install and configure the database of your choice that is supported by JDBC.
   - Create a new database and an `employees` table with columns for ID, name, city, and salary.
   - Make sure you have the necessary JDBC driver for your database.

3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

4. Configure the database connection:
   - Locate the database configuration file (e.g., `db.properties` or `application.properties`) in the project.
   - Update the configuration with your database details, including the connection URL, username, password, and JDBC driver.

5. Build and run the project.


## Database Structure

The employee data is stored in a database of your choice, configured with the necessary table structure. The `employees` table should have the following columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each employee (integer, primary key).
- `name`: Name of the employee (string).
- `city`: City where the employee is located (string).
- `salary`: Salary of the employee (numeric).
